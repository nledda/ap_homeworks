**b) Which variant makes more sense for the calculator case?**

Variant 2 (letting the caller handle the exception) makes more sense in this case for several reasons:

- Separation of concerns: The divide method has a single responsibility - to perform division. It shouldn't also be responsible for deciding how to handle errors.
- Flexibility: By letting the caller handle the exception, different callers can handle the error differently based on their specific needs. Some might want to retry, others might want to use a default value, and others might want to terminate.
- Visibility: The error becomes explicit to the caller, who is made aware that something went wrong rather than silently receiving a NaN value.
- Consistency with other arithmetic operations: In Java, arithmetic operations typically signal errors through exceptions rather than returning special values.
- Better testability: Methods that throw exceptions rather than handling them internally are easier to test.

**c) An example where the other variant (handling exceptions within the method) makes more sense:**


An example where handling exceptions internally (Variant 1) would make more sense is a utility method in a library that needs to be robust and shouldn't interrupt program flow for common/expected error conditions.
For instance, a parsing method that converts string values to numbers might internally handle format exceptions:
javapublic static int parseIntSafely(String str, int defaultValue) {
try {
return Integer.parseInt(str);
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
return defaultValue;
}
}
This makes sense because:

The method clearly communicates through its name that it's a "safe" operation.
It provides a default value parameter, making it explicit that error handling is happening.
The exception is an expected part of normal operation, not an exceptional condition.
The caller might be working with many strings and doesn't want to wrap each parse in a try-catch.
Parsing failures are common and expected when dealing with user input

In summary, internal exception handling makes sense when:

- The exception is part of normal operation
- The recovery strategy is clear and limited
- The method's contract includes handling errors
- The error handling is a core part of the functionality the method provides
